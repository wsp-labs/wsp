// land in logs); a computer that is not this one redeems a one-time pairing
// code as the first frame of a socket and holds a device token of its own
// afterwards; anything else that needs to authenticate a NEW socket uses a
// 5-minute single-use ticket minted over an authed socket (`ticket.issue`) and
// redeemed as `?ticket=...` on the next connect.
