// state_<schema version>.sqlite, table threads, one row per thread id (the
// catalog's measured row for codex). Two columns name a thread: title, which
// the CLI fills from the thread's opening words and never leaves null, and
// name, which stays null until the person names the thread, so name wins where
// it has one, and a rename from here lands in that same column through the
// app server. Measured on codex-cli 0.153.0 against state_5.sqlite.
