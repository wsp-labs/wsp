// The composer under the chat thread: the transplanted prompt editor, slash
// menu, send and stop buttons over one draft per workspace. The send key the
// person picked (Enter, or the platform's mod with Enter, the other making a
// new line) starts one turn through sessions.start in the thread the view shows unless a new thread
// was requested; the runtime resumes that thread's latest session, or, after a
// launch that failed, runs the message as its first turn. A failed send puts
// the draft back. Stop
// sends one sessions.interrupt for the turn on screen and waits, disabled,
// for the turn's end; the runtime pushes the interrupted done before it
// answers, and the composer opens when the process exits. not-running means
// the turn beat the click and is no error; not-found, a refused request and a
// stop whose process outlives STOP_WAIT each raise a flyout. The composer has
// no line above its box. The editor is disabled with the reason while the
// runtime is not live or the agents here have not answered yet, and one
// reading of that reason serves the send button's name and hover and the
// Enter path alike: the button is held at the weight every held primary wears
// with the reason on its hover, and an Enter leaves the draft where it was
// typed and raises the reason as a flyout, so Enter never fails silently. A workspace whose machine is not
// answering keeps its editor open and holds the send alone, so the wait can be
// spent writing the message that goes when the machine answers. A running turn
// blocks nothing: with queue picked, Enter then queues the message under the thread's key in the
// draft store, a card stacks above the box with the files it goes with, and
// when the turn ends the head
// row starts the next turn; a fresh thread's rows wait under the workspace id
// until its own first start names it, then move under that id, whichever
// thread is on screen when that start lands. Every send holds the thread's
// rows until its start lands, so a start the runtime refuses or a harness
// that dies before init drains nothing behind it. Rows read back from storage
// are held too. Held rows go only after the person's next send here, never on
// their own, and a row typed during a turn goes ahead of the held ones it
// releases. With steer picked, a send during a turn whose harness's catalog says
// it steers goes now, with its images where the catalog says steersImages: to
// the head, then into the running turn through sessions.steer, leaving the
// queue once the runtime took it (the thread shows it from the session.steer
// event), while not-running leaves it at the head for the turn's end. A harness
// that does not steer, or a draft with files its steer cannot carry, queues the
// message as queue does and its card says why it waits: the pick never stops
// the running turn. A card's edit puts
// its words and files back in the box. A new thread owes nothing to the
// turn it left behind: the runtime runs a workspace's threads side by side
// and holds each to one turn, so the fresh composer opens at once. The slash
// menu offers what the session's harness announced less the commands the
// runtime catalog says run only in the CLI's own terminal; with nothing left
// to offer it does not open at all and the placeholder drops its half about
// commands, since a menu that answers a typed slash with an empty state
// promises what it cannot keep. What it offers is grouped by the source the
// announcement named, in the order it named them. Enter on a screen command
// sends nothing and raises a flyout naming the wsp control that serves it. A
// draft that is a slash alone, or a slash and a name nothing announced, is
// held the way every other held send is held, on the same button, with the box
// still open since the next keystroke is what lifts it: sent, it would reach
// the agent as a command it does not have, and come back as a question about
// a stray slash with a turn's price on it. A slash command nobody announced
// with words after it still goes as text, since the words may be meant.
// Typing @, # or $ opens the thread's folder's files, the repository's open
// pull requests and issues, or the person's skills the thread's agent loads,
// and a pick lands as a chip whose text is what the agent reads. The @ and #
// menus open the moment their token is typed, saying the list is on its way;
// the pull requests and issues are asked for when the thread opens, so the
// first # draws at once, and a list that failed, came back empty or matches
// nothing says so in the menu. A file the caps turn away stands as a refused
// chip beside the ones held, the sentence why on its hover.
// Where the agent takes a side question, /btw and a question goes to the host
// instead, starts no turn and opens its own tab of the right panel on the answer.
// A file let go anywhere on the chat takes the same road as a pasted one, a key
// typed in the thread outside any field focuses the box, and the context ring's
// Compact context starts the message the agent's adapter declares as a turn.
// The checkout row under the composer picks the folder a fresh thread starts
// in; a resumed one is started where its harness last said it was. The
// model, effort, context window and access picks in the box's footer ride a
// start that opens a thread; a send into a thread that has run carries the
// model, its window and the effort, so a change mid-thread applies at the
// next turn, and never the agent or the access, which are that thread's own
// off its rows.
