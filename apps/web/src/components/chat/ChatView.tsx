// The chat thread for one workspace: the transplanted timeline over the
// adapter's entries, the empty-thread headline before the first turn, and the
// settled footer with the last turn's duration and cost. The composer is a
// render-prop slot filled by whoever mounts the view. A new-thread request
// for this workspace clears the thread, whether it arrived before or after
// the view mounted; a view pinned to an older thread unpins first, since the
// new thread opens as the workspace's latest. A send from a thread that never
// started runs as that thread's first turn, so the pin stays where it is.
// Under the transcript stand the threads this one's agent opened, one line each
// with where it runs and its status, and the footer weighs the turn's own cost
// against what those threads spent.
// A subagent's page is the same view over the lead's transcript cut to that
// subagent's lines, with no turn of its own to fold, count or close.
