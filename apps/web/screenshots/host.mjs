 * the wsp under test and shape what it lists. The path is the one thing carried over, since the agents a turn runs
 * are found on it, and it is this computer's own rather than this shell's: the wrappers a harness puts first on its
 * own path are that harness's, and a turn that ran one never answered.
 *
 * The home a turn's agent runs under rides beside the host's. The screenshot run leaves it the person's, since it
 * runs no turn; a lab names its own, which is what keeps this Mac's own MCP servers and skills out of a tester's
 * thread. An agent under a home that is not the person's reads no sign-in of theirs, so a lab signs its own home
 * in with the agents' key instead (measured 2026-09-12: neither a copy of their agent's file nor a link to their
 * keychain carries a subscription sign-in under another home).
 *
 * A lab's own home takes each agent's store with it. The home alone does not: the agent this computer runs looks
 * its user instructions up under the home the login record names, whatever HOME says, and a tester's turn quoted
 * the person's own instruction file back at them (measured 2026-09-12). The variable each agent reads its store
 * from is the catalog's to name, so this moves them all by one rule rather than by a word written here.
 *
 * A folder for the stand-in's own machines rides with it where the caller names one. A lab does: its testers open
 * panes on those machines, and a fork with a folder has a daemon, so its terminal, its processes and its live
 * readings answer instead of reading unreachable six ways. The screenshot run names none, since it photographs
 * screens rather than driving machines and a daemon per fork is a process per fork on this computer; it names the
 * stand-in's records file instead, so the fixture's sleeping forks come up asleep with nothing running on any of
 * them.
 *
 * The address a machine dials this host at is the caller's to name, and a lab names its own: the machines its forks
 * stand on are this computer, so the address is this computer's loopback. Without one the runtime hands a turn no
 * token of its own, and every tool call an agent in a thread makes arrives as the person: no opener on a thread a
 * thread opened, no cap on what it may fork, and no tree.
