// the setup a tester meets. Nothing here is a real computer, a real key or a
// real folder, and the copies are served by the provider that answers out of
// memory, so no fixture dials anything.
//
// One workspace stands on one machine, and this computer is one machine, so no
// fixture puts two rows on it: a sidebar wsp refuses to make is a sidebar a
// tester judges the product by, and one read three rows here and could not say
// which computer two of them were on.
//
// Every folder a fixture names sits under the home the host serving it runs
// in, and a workspace of the local kind is named the way wsp names one here. A
// tester given somebody else's home and somebody else's threads spent their
// first minute working out whose Mac they were on, and a project folder under
// the person's own home put a tester's turn inside the person's real
