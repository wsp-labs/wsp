// home, serves a fixture state out of it with the built wsp command on two free
// ports, drives Chromium over the surfaces list and leaves a folder of PNGs and

// WSP_HOME both point into the temp folder, which is where every file the host
// writes for itself then lands.
//
// Themes are emulated as the computer's colour scheme rather than written onto
// the root: the preference record a fixture serves names no side, so `system`
// stands and the scheme is the only thing that flips the `dark` class the
// stylesheet reads. Every shot checks the class once the app is up, so a theme
// that stopped following the scheme fails the run instead of shipping two
// identical files.
//
// A surface that names a fixture of its own is served by a second host on the
// same run: one state file cannot hold both a person whose image is built and
// one whose image never was.
