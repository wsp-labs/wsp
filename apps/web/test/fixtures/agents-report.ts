# Frontend design

Pick one bold direction before writing a line, and hold it through every screen.

## When to use it

- A new page, component or app shell that should not look generated.
- A redesign where the brief names a mood rather than a layout.

## How

1. Name the direction in one sentence.
2. Choose two typefaces and one accent, and write them down.
3. Build the smallest screen that shows all three.

\`\`\`css
:root { --accent: oklch(0.72 0.17 45); }
\`\`\`

See [the reference](https://skills.sh) for worked examples.
